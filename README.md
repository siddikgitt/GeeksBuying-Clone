Hello Everyone, My name is Siddikkhan Imtiyajkhan Pathan. Currently, I’m in Unit 2 at Masai School. Masai School give project in last week of every unit. Masai School made team of 6 member (Akash, Siddikkhan, Vishesh, Yedhu, Suman, Ajeet). Our project was to make clone of geekbuying website.

Project Details:

Geekbuying.com is an international website founded in 2012 with the mission of creating a platform that truly puts the customer first. Geekbuying covers Asia, Europe and North America.

My task was to clone the product page which is must in an ecommerce website and a brand page (where all the brands listed on website will be shown).

How I cloned Geekbuying website?

First I would like to thank all my team members to help each other. Because of them I solved my silly mistake like spelling mistakes, syntax error, etc.

I started my work with the brand categories part where I sorted the brand alphabetical order. So when the user click the letter it will show brand starting with that letter. After that I made the featured brand box where all the premium brand of website will be shown in this box. And at last we displayed all the brand which are listed in Geeksbuying website.

Below are the snippets of the brand page:

After the brand page I have made the product page where the product will be displayed. Where all the product details will be displayed such as product name, price, discount, and MRP. Below is the snippet of product page.
